## Why this lesson exists

Security engineering becomes dependable when its inputs, dependencies, failure behavior, and evidence are visible. This day builds one professional Python habit through a bounded local exercise.

## Prerequisites

Complete Day 26, keep [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) available, and read [SAFETY_AND_LAB_RULES.md](../SAFETY_AND_LAB_RULES.md).

## Outcomes

You can explain the concept, trace the starter, make one controlled change, test a normal and negative case, and document one security limitation.

## The problem

A security utility often fails at a boundary: installation, command-line input, configuration, data serialization, logging, review, dependencies, or design assumptions. Today makes one such boundary explicit.

## Security boundary

Use only synthetic data and local files. Do not add real credentials, private evidence, public targets, or network access to the starter. Stop if the exercise leaves its documented scope.

## Core lesson

Git provides a time-ordered record of changes. A review should make the security-relevant delta easy to inspect: input boundaries, permissions, logging, dependencies, tests, and documentation.

```text
git diff --check
git diff
python -m pytest -q
```

A commit message explains intent; it does not prove correctness. A reviewer asks what changed, what could fail, what was tested, and whether the change expands access or data collection.

Security connection: traceability supports accountability, rollback, and incident investigation.

### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treating tools as magic | The learner cannot reproduce the result | State the interpreter, input, command, and expected output |
| Trusting representation | Malformed data enters the decision layer | Validate fields and types at the boundary |
| Logging everything | Secrets or private data appear in output | Minimize, redact, and test logging behavior |
| Confusing a control with proof | A checklist is called “secure” | Name the test and the residual risk |

## Practice

### Level 1 — Mechanical

Run the starter, predict one output, change one value, and explain the result.

### Level 2 — Applied

Build a small local utility that uses today's idea with synthetic input. State its contract and acceptance criteria before coding.

### Level 3 — Synthesis

Add one failure case, one test, and a short threat-model note naming an asset, boundary, threat, control, and residual risk.

Use [practice/prompts.md](practice/prompts.md), then progressive [hints](practice/hints.md), then explained [solutions](practice/solutions.md).

## Mental model

> A security decision is easier to trust when another person can see what changed, why it changed, and which tests support it.

## Finish line

Run `python -m course_days.day027`, pass the phase tests, complete Levels 1 and 2, and write one edge-case note.
