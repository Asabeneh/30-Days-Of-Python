# Day 4

## Strings

Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method.

### Creating a String

```py
letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying 30 days of Python Challenge"
print(sentence)
```

Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or triple double quotes ("""). See the example below.

```py
multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python.'''
print(multiline_string)

# Another way of doing the same thing
multiline_string = """I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python."""
print(multiline_string)
```

### String Concatenation

We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:

```py
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16
```

### Escape Sequences in Strings

In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab means(8 spaces)
- \\\\: Back slash
- \\': Single quote (')
- \\": Double quote (")

Now, let us see the use of the above escape sequences with examples.

```py
print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises') # adding tab space or 4 spaces 
print('Day 1\t5\t5')
print('Day 2\t6\t20')
print('Day 3\t5\t23')
print('Day 4\t1\t35')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"') # to write a double quote inside a single quote

# output
I hope every one is enjoying the Python Challenge.
Are you ?
Days	Topics	Exercises
Day 1	5	    5
Day 2	6	    20
Day 3	5	    23
Day 4	1	    35
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
```

### String formatting

#### Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)

In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them.
The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.<small>number of digits</small>f".

- %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
- %d - Integers
- %f - Floating point numbers
- "%.<small>number of digits</small>f" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

```py
# Strings only
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']"
```

#### New Style String Formatting (str.format)

This formatting is introduced in Python version 3.

```py

first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am {} {}. I teach {}'.format(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)
a = 4
b = 3

print('{} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))
print('{} - {} = {}'.format(a, b, a - b))
print('{} * {} = {}'.format(a, b, a * b))
print('{} / {} = {:.2f}'.format(a, b, a / b)) # limits it to two digits after decimal
print('{} % {} = {}'.format(a, b, a % b))
print('{} // {} = {}'.format(a, b, a // b))
print('{} ** {} = {}'.format(a, b, a ** b))

# output
4 + 3 = 7
4 - 3 = 1
4 * 3 = 12
4 / 3 = 1.33
4 % 3 = 1
4 // 3 = 1
4 ** 3 = 64

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of a circle with a radius {} is {:.2f}.'.format(radius, area) # 2 digits after decimal
print(formated_string)

```

#### String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)

Another new string formatting is string interpolation, f-strings. Strings start with f and we can inject the data in their corresponding positions.

```py
a = 4
b = 3
print(f'{a} + {b} = {a +b}')
print(f'{a} - {b} = {a - b}')
print(f'{a} * {b} = {a * b}')
print(f'{a} / {b} = {a / b:.2f}')
print(f'{a} % {b} = {a % b}')
print(f'{a} // {b} = {a // b}')
print(f'{a} ** {b} = {a ** b}')
```

### Python Strings as Sequences of Characters

Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects â€“ lists and tuples. The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

#### Unpacking Characters

```
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n
```

#### Accessing Characters in Strings by Index

In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.

![String index](../images/string_index.png)

```py
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
```

If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.

```py
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o
```

#### Slicing Python Strings

In python we can slice strings into substrings.

```py
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
```

#### Reversing a String

We can easily reverse strings in python.

```py
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting[::-1]) # !dlroW ,olleH
```

#### Skipping Characters While Slicing

It is possible to skip characters while slicing by passing step argument to slice method.

```py
language = 'Python'
pto = language[0:6:2] #
print(pto) # Pto
```

### String Methods

There are many string methods which allow us to format strings. See some of the string methods in the following example:

- capitalize(): Converts the first character of the string to capital letter

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.capitalize()) # 'Thirty days of python'
```

- count(): returns occurrences of substring in string, count(substring, start=.., end=..). The start is a starting indexing for counting and end is the last index to count.

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.count('y')) # 3
print(challenge.count('y', 7, 14)) # 1, 
print(challenge.count('th')) # 2`
```

- endswith(): Checks if a string ends with a specified ending

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.endswith('on'))   # True
print(challenge.endswith('tion')) # False
```

- expandtabs(): Replaces tab character with spaces, default tab size is 8. It takes tab size argument

```py
challenge = 'thirty\tdays\tof\tpython'
print(challenge.expandtabs())   # 'thirty  days    of      python'
print(challenge.expandtabs(10)) # 'thirty    days      of        python'
```

- find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.find('y'))  # 5
print(challenge.find('th')) # 0
```

- rfind(): Returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.rfind('y'))  # 16
print(challenge.rfind('th')) # 17
```

- format(): formats string into a nicer output  
   More about string formatting check this [link](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/format)

```py
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
age = 250
job = 'teacher'
country = 'Finland'
sentence = 'I am {} {}. I am a {}. I am {} years old. I live in {}.'.format(first_name, last_name, age, job, country)
print(sentence) # I am Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250 years old. I am a teacher. I live in Finland.

radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
result = 'The area of a circle with radius {} is {}'.format(str(radius), str(area))
print(result) # The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314
```

- index(): Returns the lowest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1). If the substring is not found it raises a valueError. 

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.index(sub_string))  # 7
print(challenge.index(sub_string, 9)) # error
```

- rindex(): Returns the highest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string))  # 7
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string, 9)) # error
print(challenge.rindex('on', 8)) # 19
```

- isalnum(): Checks alphanumeric character

```py
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = '30DaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False, space is not an alphanumeric character

challenge = 'thirty days of python 2019'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False
```

- isalpha(): Checks if all string elements are alphabet characters (a-z and A-Z)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # False, space is once again excluded
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # True
num = '123'
print(num.isalpha())      # False
```

- isdecimal(): Checks if all characters in a string are decimal (0-9)

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # False
challenge = '123'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # True
challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdecimal())   # False
challenge = '12 3'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # False, space not allowed
```

- isdigit(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers (0-9 and some other unicode characters for numbers)

```py
challenge = 'Thirty'
print(challenge.isdigit()) # False
challenge = '30'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
```

- isnumeric(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers or number related (just like isdigit(), just accepts more symbols, like Â½)

```py
num = '10'
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '\u00BD' # Â½
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '10.5'
print(num.isnumeric()) # False
```

- isidentifier(): Checks for a valid identifier - it checks if a string is a valid variable name

```py
challenge = '30DaysOfPython'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # False, because it starts with a number
challenge = 'thirty_days_of_python'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # True
```

- islower(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are lowercase

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # True
challenge = 'Thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # False
```

- isupper(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are uppercase

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isupper()) #  False
challenge = 'THIRTY DAYS OF PYTHON'
print(challenge.isupper()) # True
```

- join(): Returns a concatenated string

```py
web_tech = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React']
result = ' '.join(web_tech)
print(result) # 'HTML CSS JavaScript React'
```

```py
web_tech = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React']
result = '# '.join(web_tech)
print(result) # 'HTML# CSS# JavaScript# React'
```

- strip(): Removes all given characters starting from the beginning and end of the string

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of pythoonnn'
print(challenge.strip('noth')) # 'irty days of py'
```

- replace(): Replaces substring with a given string

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.replace('python', 'coding')) # 'thirty days of coding'
```

- split(): Splits the string, using given string or space as a separator

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.split()) # ['thirty', 'days', 'of', 'python']
challenge = 'thirty, days, of, python'
print(challenge.split(', ')) # ['thirty', 'days', 'of', 'python']
```

- title(): Returns a title cased string

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.title()) # Thirty Days Of Python
```

- swapcase(): Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and all lowercase characters to uppercase characters

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.swapcase())   # THIRTY DAYS OF PYTHON
challenge = 'Thirty Days Of Python'
print(challenge.swapcase())  # tHIRTY dAYS oF pYTHON
```

- startswith(): Checks if String Starts with the Specified String

```py
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.startswith('thirty')) # True
