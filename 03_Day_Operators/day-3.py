#First Learn to identify which is operator and which is operands?
total=a+b
#In the above total is a variable which holds value returned after performing calculation.
#Operators are symbols which help to perform specific tasks
#operands are the values on which operators perform the tasks.
#a and b are operands
#+ is a operator
