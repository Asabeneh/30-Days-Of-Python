    "\n",
    "A boolean data type represents one of the two values: _True_ or _False_. The use of these data types will be clear once we start using the comparison operator. The first letter **T** for True and **F** for False should be capital unlike JavaScript.\n",

    "### Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below shows the different types of python assignment operators, taken from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).\n",

    "- Addition(+): a + b\n",
    "- Subtraction(-): a - b\n",
    "- Multiplication(*): a * b\n",
    "- Division(/): a / b\n",
    "- Modulus(%): a % b\n",
    "- Floor division(//): a // b\n",
    "- Exponentiation(**): a ** b\n",
