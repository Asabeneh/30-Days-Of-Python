## Why this lesson exists

Security engineering becomes dependable when its inputs, dependencies, failure behavior, and evidence are visible. This day builds one professional Python habit through a bounded local exercise.

## Prerequisites

Complete Day 24, keep [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) available, and read [SAFETY_AND_LAB_RULES.md](../SAFETY_AND_LAB_RULES.md).

## Outcomes

You can explain the concept, trace the starter, make one controlled change, test a normal and negative case, and document one security limitation.

## The problem

A security utility often fails at a boundary: installation, command-line input, configuration, data serialization, logging, review, dependencies, or design assumptions. Today makes one such boundary explicit.

## Security boundary

Use only synthetic data and local files. Do not add real credentials, private evidence, public targets, or network access to the starter. Stop if the exercise leaves its documented scope.

## Core lesson

Type hints provide a shared vocabulary for data shapes and make editor feedback more useful. They are erased at runtime, so a value read from JSON still needs runtime validation.

```python
from typing import TypedDict


class Event(TypedDict):
    source: str
    severity: int
```

Static checking can catch a missing key in code that claims to build `Event`. It cannot confirm that a remote sender actually followed the contract.

Security connection: types reduce accidental misuse inside the program; boundary validation handles reality.

### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treating tools as magic | The learner cannot reproduce the result | State the interpreter, input, command, and expected output |
| Trusting representation | Malformed data enters the decision layer | Validate fields and types at the boundary |
| Logging everything | Secrets or private data appear in output | Minimize, redact, and test logging behavior |
| Confusing a control with proof | A checklist is called “secure” | Name the test and the residual risk |

## Exercises

Complete the numbered questions in [practice/exercises.md](practice/exercises.md) in order. Run the requested commands, produce the requested artifact, and record the edge case or limitation asked for by the exercise. Use [hints](practice/hints.md) only after a real attempt and [solutions](practice/solutions.md) only to compare your reasoning.

## Mental model

> A type annotation documents an expected shape, while runtime checks defend the boundary where real data enters.

## Finish line

Run the starter, pass the relevant tests, complete the numbered exercises, and explain one edge case aloud or in writing.
