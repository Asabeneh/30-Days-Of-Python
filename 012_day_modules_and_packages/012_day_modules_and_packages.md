## Why this lesson exists

Python becomes useful in cybersecurity when its behavior is predictable, testable, and explainable. This day introduces a professional engineering idea through a small local problem before asking you to combine it with other tools.

## Prerequisites

You should be able to run the previous day, write a small function, and use the setup in [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md). If a term is unfamiliar, return to the previous lesson rather than copying a later pattern.

## Outcomes

By the end, you can explain the core concept, trace the starter, predict a changed result, write a normal and negative test, and state what the exercise does not prove about a real system.

## The problem

Security data is untrusted, incomplete, and easy to misinterpret. The problem today is to make one transformation or decision explicit enough that another learner can run it, test it, and review its assumptions.

## Security boundary

Use only the synthetic fixtures supplied by the course or a local file you created. Do not substitute public targets, university systems, employer systems, real credentials, or private evidence. Read `lab/scope.md` before changing the exercise.

## Core lesson

A module is a Python file with a namespace. Packages group related modules. The boundary matters because import-time work can create surprising side effects and because a reviewer needs to know where a security decision lives.

### Problem first

Move parsing and policy helpers out of a single script without making imports execute network calls, read secrets, or modify files.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Event:
    kind: str
    source: str
```

### Execution trace

When Python imports a module, it executes its top-level statements once and stores the module object. Definitions are made available to the importer. Code that should happen only when a file is run directly belongs under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

### Security connection

Keep imports predictable. Avoid hidden side effects, circular imports, wildcard imports, and package initializers that load credentials or contact services. A module boundary should make the data flow easier to inspect.


### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Using a broad catch-all | A real failure looks like an empty success | Catch expected boundary errors and preserve unexpected failures |
| Skipping the raw value | A reviewer cannot reproduce the decision | Keep raw input next to normalized or parsed fields |
| Assuming a type hint is validation | Malformed runtime data still enters the function | Validate at the boundary and test rejection |
| Optimizing before measuring | The code becomes harder to explain | Build the simplest correct version, then measure |

## Practice

### Level 1 — Mechanical

Run `python -m course_days.day012`. Predict one output, change one input, and explain the difference.

### Level 2 — Applied

Complete [practice/prompts.md](practice/prompts.md) using the supplied synthetic fixture. State the input contract and acceptance criteria before coding.

### Level 3 — Synthesis

Add one edge case, one negative test, and one paragraph distinguishing observation, inference, and residual risk.

Review [practice/hints.md](practice/hints.md) only after a real attempt and [practice/solutions.md](practice/solutions.md) only to compare decisions.

## Mental model

> Modules, Imports, and Package Boundaries is valuable when the boundary, assumptions, failure behavior, and evidence are visible.

## Finish line

Run the starter, pass the phase tests, complete Levels 1 and 2, and explain one edge case aloud or in writing.
